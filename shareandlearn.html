								<h2>What is Share and Learn?</h2>
								<p>A Global Facebook Community</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Share and Learn is collection of four Facebook Community Groups created to support teams in all four FIRST programs started by Sanjay and Arvind Seshan (members of FRC 8027). Over the years, these groups have brought together team members, coaches, mentors, volunteers, organizers, LEGO Education and FIRST employees. FLL: Share & Learn is the flagship group, founded in 2017. Soon, collaborators asked to create one for all the other FIRST programs. All four groups are monitored by adult admin and FRC 8027 members who have experience in all four FIRST programs. They are FIRST-focussed groups where we uphold the spirit of each of the FIRST programs while providing the support that teams need.

									<h3>Community Initiatives</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
								Over the years, Share & Learn has been responsible for the creation of many ways to bring the FIRST community together. The groups provide a lot of support for rookie teams in all four programs and many materials created and posted on FLLTutorials.com are the result of the needs of the Share & Learn Community. In 2020, with Covid-19 causing the suspension of the FIRST season, members of Share & Learn decided to band together to come up with ways to keep the community engaged. So many teams had events (including Worlds) cancelled. They first came up with a way to host a Virtual Expo for Junior teams. Inspired by the community's response, they decided to host an all-virtual Open Invitational for teams.
