								<h2>What is Share and Learn?</h2>
								<p>A Global Facebook Community</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Share and Learn is collection of four Facebook Community Groups created to support youth robotics teams started by <a href="http://www.droidsrobotics.org">Droids Robotics</a>. Over the years, these groups have brought together team members, coaches, mentors, volunteers and organizers. FLL Challenge: Share & Learn is the flagship group, founded in 2017.

									<h3>Community Initiatives</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
								Over the years, Droids Robotics has been responsible for the creation of many ways to bring the youth robotics community together. The groups provide a lot of support for rookie teams in all programs and many materials created and posted on FLLTutorials.com are the result of the needs of the Share & Learn Community. In 2020, with Covid-19 causing the suspension of the FIRST season, Droids Robotics led the initiative to come up with ways to keep the community engaged. So many teams had events (including Worlds) cancelled. They first came up with a way to host a Virtual Expo for Junior teams. Inspired by the community's response, they decided to host an all-virtual Open Invitational for teams.
