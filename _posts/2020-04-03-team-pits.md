<p>Despite being a all-virtual event, the organizers wanted to have a way for students on teams to meet and socialize. They came up with the Virtual Team Pits.</p>

<p>In a special area where only team members, coaches, and volunteers can "hang out", teams are encouraged to chat, share images and stories and play games together. They even have a private Minecraft server set up for all the kids to play together.</p>
