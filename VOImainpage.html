											<h3>About the 2020 event</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											48 teams from 20 countries have joined together to compete and have fun in this unique first-of-its kind event. To check out all of the amazing teams competing, go <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/2020/04/04/meet-the-open-teams.html"> here </a>. Teams will have the fun competition experience in an all-virtual format. They will send in pre-recorded videos for their judges to see. Judges are very experienced and will be able to provide teams with feedback. Teams will also perform a live robot run which experienced referees will watch and score. For the inaugral 2020 event, there will be flexibility for teams with no access to their robot game table.

										In addition, there are opening and closing ceremonies, a virtual expert zone, a keynote speaker, game announcers and emcees. Th entire event will be livestreamed by FIRST Updates Now.
